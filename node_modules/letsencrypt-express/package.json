that you are likely to run up against\nwhen using letsencrypt for your first time.\n\nIn order to avoid being blocked by hitting rate limits with bad requests,\nyou should always test against the `'staging'` server\n(`https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org/directory`) first.\n\nMigrating from v1.x\n===================\n\nWhereas v1.x had a few hundred lines of code, v2.x is a single small file of about 50 lines.\nNow All of the behavior has moved to the various plugins, which each have their own options, respectively.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThe oversimplified example was the bait\n(because everyone seems to want an example that fits in 3 lines, even if it's terribly bad practices),\nnow here's the switch:\n\n`serve.js`:\n```javascript\n'use strict';\n\n// returns an instance of node-letsencrypt with additional helper methods\nvar lex = require('letsencrypt-express').create({\n  // set to https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory in production\n  server: 'staging'\n\n// If you wish to replace the default plugins, you may do so here\n//\n, challenges: { 'http-01:' require('le-challenge-fs').create({ webrootPath: '/tmp/acme-challenges' }) }\n, store: require('le-store-certbot').create({ webrootPath: '/tmp/acme-challenges' })\n\n// You probably wouldn't need to replace the default sni handler\n// See https://github.com/Daplie/le-sni-auto if you think you do\n//, sni: require('le-sni-auto').create({})\n\n, approveDomains: approveDomains\n});\n```\n\n```javascript\nfunction approveDomains(opts, certs, cb) {\n  // This is where you check your database and associated\n  // email addresses with domains and agreements and such\n\n\n  // The domains being approved for the first time are listed in opts.domains\n  // Certs being renewed are listed in certs.altnames\n  if (certs) {\n    opts.domains = certs.altnames;\n  }\n  else {\n    opts.email = 'john.doe@example.com';\n    opts.agreeTos = true;\n  }\n\n  cb(null, { options: opts, certs: certs });\n}\n```\n\n\n```javascript\n// handles acme-challenge and redirects to https\nrequire('http').createServer(lex.middleware()).listen(80, function () {\n  console.log(\"Listening for ACME http-01 challenges on\", this.address());\n});\n\n\n\nvar app = require('express')();\napp.use('/', function (req, res) {\n  res.end('Hello, World!');\n});\n\n// handles your app\nrequire('https').createServer(lex.httpsOptions, lex.middleware(app)).listen(443, function () {\n  console.log(\"Listening for ACME tls-sni-01 challenges and serve app on\", this.address());\n});\n```\n\n**Security Warning**:\n\nIf you don't do proper checks in `approveDomains(opts, certs, cb)`\nan attacker will spoof SNI packets with bad hostnames and that will\ncause you to be rate-limited and or blocked from the ACME server.\n\n\nAPI\n===\n\nThis module is an elaborate ruse (to provide an oversimplified example and to nab some SEO).\n\nThe API is actually located at [node-letsencrypt options](https://github.com/Daplie/node-letsencrypt)\n(because all options are simply passed through to `node-letsencrypt` proper without modification).\n\nThe only \"API\" consists of two options, the rest is just a wrapper around `node-letsencrypt` to take LOC from 15 to 5:\n\n* `opts.app` An express app in the format `function (req, res) { ... }` (no `next`).\n* `lex.listen(plainPort, tlsPort)` Accepts port numbers (or arrays of port numbers) to listen on.\n\nBrief overview of some simple options for `node-letsencrypt`:\n\n* `opts.server` set to https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory in production\n* `opts.email` The default email to use to accept agreements.\n* `opts.agreeTos` When set to `true`, this always accepts the LetsEncrypt TOS. When a string it checks the agreement url first.\n* `opts.approveDomains` can be either of:\n  * An explicit array of allowed domains such as `[ 'example.com', 'www.example.com' ]`\n  * A callback `function (opts, certs, cb) { cb(null, { options: opts, certs: certs }); }` for setting `email`, `agreeTos`, `domains`, etc (as shown in usage example above)\n* `opts.renewWithin` is the **maximum** number of days (in ms) before expiration to renew a certificate.\n* `opts.renewBy` is the **minimum** number of days (in ms) before expiration to renew a certificate.\n",
